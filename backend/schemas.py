class AuthConfig(BaseModel):
    """
    Optional form-based login for authenticated scanning - webscan.py (ZAP
    context/forcedUser) and owasp.py (its own requests.Session) log in once
    before crawling/testing, so real vulnerabilities behind a login wall
    (the dominant gap across this tool's practicality testing - see
    docs/test_findings.md) are actually reachable.

    Never persisted (see tasks/auth_store.py's docstring) - routers/scan.py
    writes this straight to Redis, never onto the Scan row in models.py.

    Two login shapes, selected by login_type ('auto' by default - the login
    URL is GETted and sniffed, so the common case needs only login_url +
    username + password; 'form'/'json' force it):
      - 'form': application/x-www-form-urlencoded POST. owasp.py and
        webscan.py's ZAP script both GET the login page, submit every field on
        it with username/password overridden (picks up CSRF tokens + submit-
        button fields with no special-casing).
      - 'json': JSON-API login (modern SPAs - e.g. Juice Shop POSTing
        {email, password} to /rest/user/login). POSTs the creds as a JSON body
        (username_field/password_field double as the JSON keys), reads a bearer
        token out of the response via token_json_path, and sends it as
        token_header (default 'Authorization: Bearer <token>') on every
        subsequent request - owasp.py as a Session header, webscan.py via ZAP's
        Replacer add-on. See tasks/auth_login.py.

    logged_in_indicator is used by owasp.py's _make_session() only, as a
    one-time, best-effort check right after login (log a warning if it
    doesn't match, nothing more). webscan.py's ZAP setup deliberately never
    touches this field - confirmed by direct testing that handing the same
    regex to zap.authentication.set_logged_in_indicator() makes ZAP check it
    against every single response the spider/active-scanner receives
    (including CSS/JS/image/redirect/error responses that legitimately don't
    contain it), and ZAP's "Insights" add-on counts each non-match as an
    auth failure - hit its self-shutdown threshold in ~1 second of real
    scanning in testing. See webscan.py's auth-setup comment for the full
    story. Do not wire this field into ZAP's authentication config.
