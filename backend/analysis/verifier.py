"""
Confidence verification stage - runs between aggregate() and score_finding()
(scan_orchestrator.py's _finalize()).

HARD CONSTRAINT: every verifier here does passive re-observation only - it
re-issues the exact same non-destructive, read-only payload the originating
scanning module already used (owasp.py/enumeration.py/webscan.py) and checks
whether the same evidence still reproduces. No verifier may escalate to a
new exploitation technique, write data, or use a payload the source module
didn't already send once during the scan. If you're adding a verifier and
it does anything beyond "GET (or headless-browser-navigate to) the same
thing again and compare the response", it does not belong in this file -
ARCHITECTURE.md Section 8's non-destructive guardrail applies here exactly as it
does to the scanning modules. verify_reflected_xss (Phase 2) is the one
verifier that uses a browser instead of raw `requests` - it still only
re-issues owasp.py's own already-sent payload and observes whether the
same alert() call fires, nothing more.

On failure to reproduce (wrong response, timeout, connection error, or
missing verification_target data), a finding is demoted to
confidence='unverified' with a verification_note explaining why - it is
NEVER dropped from the findings list. Silently dropping a finding here would
reintroduce the exact silent-data-loss bug class ARCHITECTURE.md Section 4.3 warns
about for the aggregator, just one stage later.
