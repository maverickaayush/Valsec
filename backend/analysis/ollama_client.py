    Used when Ollama is unreachable, times out, or never returns valid JSON.
    Every finding gets the same deterministic (description, remediation) pair
    _score_and_describe() already gives any finding that never reaches the AI
    batch in the first place - a templated type (never sent to Ollama at all),
    or one that ranked outside the top-50 cutoff despite Ollama succeeding
    overall. A total Ollama outage is just the same "no AI text for this
    finding" situation for every finding at once, not a reason to discard the
    perfectly good, non-hallucinated templates that already exist for it.
    Real bug found live: this used to hardcode a generic "AI-generated
    description unavailable" placeholder for every finding regardless of
    type, which meant a scan whose findings were entirely templated types
    (guaranteed-concrete text "every time" per the module's own docstring)
    still lost that text the moment Ollama happened to be down - reproduced
    against a real historical scan (bwapp.local) during the AI+template
    pipeline replay. The scan-level ai_unavailable flag (not per-finding
    text) is what actually drives the report's "AI analysis unavailable"
    badge, so nothing is lost by using the real description here.
