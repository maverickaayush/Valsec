    disconnected_mid_scan is distinct from "ZAP never became reachable at

    """
    Pure half (runs locally or on Modal via tasks.dispatch). On Modal, ZAP runs
    in-container (config.ZAP_URL empty -> _run_zap's local-daemon spawn/kill
    branch). `auth` is passed in by the dispatcher (fetched from Redis on the
    droplet); the pure half never reads Redis, so it runs on a stateless Modal
    container.

    Web scan module: OWASP ZAP (spider + active scan) + Katana (parallel,
    JS-aware supplemental crawl) + Nikto.

    ZAP, Katana and Nikto are all optional - if any is missing (never
    reachable at all) the module continues with whatever is available, and
    partial results are still reported as 'success' (that case is a startup-
    time absence, not a mid-scan failure). Runs with a raised per-task time
    limit because ZAP active scanning is the pipeline's long pole (see the
    timing-budget note above). Katana runs in a thread ALONGSIDE ZAP so it
    adds no wall-clock time; Nikto still runs sequentially after both finish.
    Returns a build_module_result() envelope (Section 4.3 schema note).

    A second, distinct case - ZAP going unreachable *after* scanning already
    started (a mid-scan daemon restart) - is reported as 'partial' with a
    descriptive error instead, the same pattern tech_fingerprint.py uses when
    exactly one of whatweb/wafw00f fails. See `_run_zap`'s docstring for why
    this distinction matters: silently reporting 'success' here previously
    made a lost ZAP scan indistinguishable from "ZAP genuinely found nothing".
