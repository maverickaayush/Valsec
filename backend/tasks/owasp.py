    Pure half (runs locally or on Modal via tasks.dispatch). `auth` is passed in
    by the dispatcher (fetched from Redis on the droplet) - the pure half never reads
    Redis itself, so it can run on a stateless Modal container.

    OWASP Top 10 module: 6 non-destructive active tests (SQLi, XSS, path
    traversal, open redirect, error disclosure, IDOR), run against a
    same-origin crawl of up to _MAX_CRAWL_PAGES pages rather than just the
    bare domain root (see _discover_urls' docstring for why).
    All payloads are read-only GET requests - no data modification ever.
    Pure Python (requests) - tool_versions is always empty for this module.
    Returns a build_module_result() envelope (Section 4.3 schema note).

    Time budget: raised from the inherited 300s/360s default. Fast (~1-2s)
    against local Docker targets, but real, measured behavior against a real
    external target (testphp.vulnweb.com, docs/test_findings.md) genuinely
    exceeded both this soft (360s) and hard (420s) limit - real internet
    latency across ~800 worst-case requests adds up fast, unlike near-instant
    local containers.

    Real bug found and fixed alongside this measurement, not just a timeout
    number: SoftTimeLimitExceeded is a plain Exception subclass (confirmed:
    `SoftTimeLimitExceeded.__mro__` includes Exception), so every one of this
    module's `except Exception` blocks - all 6 test functions, the crawl
    loop, and the outer per-URL loop below - was silently swallowing Celery's
    graceful-shutdown signal the instant it landed inside whichever one
    happened to be running, letting execution carry on to the next URL/test
    instead of unwinding. The task then ran straight into the hard time_limit
    SIGKILL every time instead of ever reaching this function's own
    `except SoftTimeLimitExceeded` handler below - exactly the "hard kill
    the orchestrator can't see" gap Section 4.3b already documents, just
    triggered every single time instead of only on a genuine runaway. Fixed
    by re-raising SoftTimeLimitExceeded before each of those broad catches,
    so it now actually reaches this function and returns a proper
    status='timeout' envelope with whatever findings were already collected,
    instead of vanishing under a SIGKILL the scan orchestrator has to wait
    out via the coarse stuck-scan reaper.
