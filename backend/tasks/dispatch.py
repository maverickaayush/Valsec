"""
Scanner dispatch layer — the single seam between the Celery orchestrator (the
DigitalOcean droplet, x86_64) and where a module's work physically runs.

Each module is split into two halves (ARCHITECTURE.md / migration plan):

  - Pure half `scan_<module>(scan_id, domain, auth) -> build_module_result envelope`
    lives in tasks/<module>.py. It does ALL tool/subprocess work and returns the
    envelope. It touches NO DB and NO Redis, so it can run unchanged on a Modal
    container (which cannot reach the droplet's private Postgres/Redis).

  - Dispatcher: the `run_<module>` Celery task calls `dispatch_scan(...)` here,
    which owns the DB status writes and picks where the pure half runs:
      SCANNER_BACKEND=local  -> run it in-process (local Docker dev; the 'full'
                                image has the scanner binaries installed).
      SCANNER_BACKEND=modal  -> modal.Function.from_name(...).remote(...).

This keeps the finding (`normalize_finding`) and module-result
(`build_module_result`) contracts identical regardless of where a module ran,
and keeps Postgres/Redis private (Modal is stateless — the dispatcher reads auth
from Redis on the droplet and passes it in as an argument).
